    <h1>My Electric Kettle: A User Personas and Storyboarding Task</h1>
    <p>I wanted to understand the user experience of using a common electric kettle. 
      To gain deep empathy, I <strong>observed</strong> my roommates when using the 
      kettle and <strong>interviewed</strong> them. Based this user research, I developed <strong>personas</strong> and a <strong>storyboard</strong>
    </p>

      <h2>The Electric Kettle</h2>
      <img src="sketch.jpg" alt="Kettle Sketch">
      <p>The Kettle is used to boil water/liquid of choice. The lid is lifted by pressing the button on the handle, so that the user can fill it with water.
        Lid can be closed using the hand to press till it shuts. The ON/OFF button is pressed to initiate heating. Once another click is heard, the water 
        is ready to be poured with handle. </p>

          <h3>Frequent Users</h3>
          
      <ul>
        <li> Started with shaking the kettle, then filling kettle with water</li>
          <li> Did not look at measuring scale</li>
            <li>Once on, users left to attend other tasks</li>
            <li>Returned to kettle upon hearing click + when heating sound stopped</li>
          </ul>
            

            <h3>First-Time Users</h3>
            
              <ul>

                  <li>  Also, did not look at measuring scale</li>
                    <li>  Moved hand around kettle. Stopped once hand found 'on' button and pressed it</li>
                        </ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> I found this exercise effective in helping develop empathy for the users of this kettle. 
  I brought my kettle into the the house so I've been using it for a while + I'm used to it. 
  So I was surprised to find that first-time users had problems finding the ON button. It was
also interesting to see frequent users optimize their time once they've been using it for a while.</p>
